title: Gump
---

Gump is a cellular automata that tastes a lot like Conway's Game of Life.  It was my first project more complex than hello world, so its code is unsightly.  But it's quite pretty and it has surprising properties.

### Built on Java

Gump is written in [Processing](https://processing.org/), a subset of Java that I love to use for 2D and 3D graphics programming.

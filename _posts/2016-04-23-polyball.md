title: polyball

polyball is a multiplayer browser game.  It's real-time and it's physics based, and it was an intense team effort.

### For the Web

polyball is written in JavaScript from front to back.  It's [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) in the back and it's [browser](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/) in the front.  It's also a direct insubordination to the old guard of JavaScript - polyball's JavaScript smells a lot like Java.  We're alright with that because it works.

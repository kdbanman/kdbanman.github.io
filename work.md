If you're interested in my help solving your software problems, or you're interested in contributing to my projects, please [get in touch]({{ site.url }}/contact).  You might get a sense of what I'm into by checking out my [GitHub portfolio][1] and my [StackOverflow page](http://stackexchange.com/users/4101827).

My presence on GitHub varies wildly in frequency.  But if you visit, you'll see experiments like [mandelgrok][2], small projects like [reportify][4], large team projects like [polyball][5] or [TravelTracker][6], and the odd contribution to other projects like [Accord.NET][7] or [Glances][8].

Lots of the code on that profile is not industrial quality, and lots of it comes from *very* early in my programming career.  But it's how I learned, so I'm happy to leave it in the public eye.  I'd love to [answer questions]({{ site.url }}/contact) about any of it!

I'm also fairly active on StackOverflow, again with wildly varying frequency.  I cannot express enough appreciation for the StackOverflow community, and the StackExchange ecosystem in general.

I'm always looking for opportunities to meaningfully contribute to good projects and teams, so [reach out]({{ site.url }}/contact) if you have one!

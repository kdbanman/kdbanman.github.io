If you're interested in my help solving your software problems, or you're interested in contributing to my projects, please [get in touch]({{ site.url }}/contact).  In the mean time, check out my [GitHub portfolio][1] and my [StackOverflow page](http://stackexchange.com/users/4101827).

My presence on GitHub has been building up steadily for several years.  It shows successes and failures, and it shows everything from experiments like [mandelgrok][2] and small projects like [reportify][4], to large team projects like [polyball][5] or [TravelTracker][6].

Lots of the code on that profile is not industrial quality, and lots of it comes from *very* early in my programming career.  But it's how I learned, so I'm happy to leave it in the public eye.  I'd love to [answer questions]({{ site.url }}/contact) about any of it!

I'm also fairly active on StackOverflow.  It's a great way to learn, and it's an excellent way to practice communication skills.

I'm looking for opportunities to grow as a developer and, and to meaningfully contribute to good projects and teams.

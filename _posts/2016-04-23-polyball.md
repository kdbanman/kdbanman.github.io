title: polyball

polyball is a multiplayer browser game.  It's real-time and it's physics based, and it was an intense team effort.

### For the Web

polyball is written in JavaScript from front to back.  [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) in the back, [browser](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/) in the front, and a direct insubordination to the old guard of JavaScript.

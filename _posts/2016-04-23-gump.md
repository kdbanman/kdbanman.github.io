title: gump
---

gump is a cellular automata that tastes a lot like Conway's Game of Life.  It was my first project more complex than hello world, so its code is unsightly.  But it's quite pretty and it has surprising properties.  Expect a future post on that.

#### Built with Java

gump is written in [Processing](https://processing.org/), a subset of Java that I love to use for 2D and 3D graphics programming.
